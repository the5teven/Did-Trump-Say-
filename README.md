# Did Trump Say? (Twitter Machine learning)
A python program that trains a machine learning text classification model and another python program that uses that trained model to predict if a quote is attributed to the 45th president of the united states.

Check out Making_the_Model.ipynb to see how I trained the model (spoiler I used Trump's Tweets, he Tweets alot).

Did_Trump_Say_Tk_GUI.py will run a fun GUI that will predict if trump said something:
